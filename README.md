# How to use this project

This project is an example of how you could set up a shopping cart based website with PHP. It doesn't use a login system or a payment gateway.

## Requires the use of composer

This website uses third-party libraries such as Plates.
These have been downloaded via composer, so if you download this project onto your own computer, make sure you open up a terminal, navigate to the root of the project folder and type `composer install`. This doesn't install composer itself, instead it downloads all the third-party libraries.

## Database provided

As I continue to build up this project I will replace the `my_online_shop_database.sql` file. All you need to do is create a database in phpMyAdmin and import this SQL file.

This saves you from having to create data.
